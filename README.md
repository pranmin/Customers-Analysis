      SET status = 'Pending'
      WHERE status = 'Pending - Waiting for Pick Up';

      UPDATE sales_report
      SET status = 'Shipping'
      WHERE status = 'Shipped - Out for Delivery';

      UPDATE sales_report
      SET status = 'Shipped'
      WHERE status = 'Shipped - Delivered to Buyer';
  
      UPDATE sales_report
      SET status = 'Shipped'
      WHERE status = 'Shipped - Picked Up'

      UPDATE sales_report
      SET status = 'Returned'
      WHERE status = 'Shipped - Rejected by Buyer'
        or status = 'Shipped - Returned to Seller'
        or status = 'Shipped - Returning to Seller'

      UPDATE sales_report
      SET status = 'Shipped'
      WHERE status = 'Shipping'

      UPDATE sales_report
      SET status = 'Issue'
      WHERE status = 'Shipped - Damaged'
        or status = 'Shipped - Lost in Transit'

      UPDATE sales_report
      set ship_state = UPPER(ship_state);
     ```
- Data exporatory
  
  1. Finding total order, total order shipped, total order cancelled
  ```sql
  --COUNT ALL THE ORDER 
  SELECT 
    COUNT (order_id) AS total_order,
    ship_state
  FROM 
    sales_report
  GROUP BY
    ship_state;

  -- COUNT ORDER THAT SHIPPED
  SELECT 
    COUNT (order_id) AS total_shipped
  FROM 
    sales_report
  WHERE status = 'Shipped';

  -- COUNT ORDER THAT GOT CANCELLED
  SELECT 
    COUNT (order_id) AS total_cancelled
  FROM 
    sales_report
  WHERE status = 'Cancelled';
  ```
  2. Finding Top sales products
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    sr.sku,  
    pd.category,
    COUNT (sr.sku) as sale_count,
    pd.asin
  FROM sales_report AS sr
  JOIN products_data AS pd 
    ON sr.sku = pd.sku
  GROUP BY sr.sku, pd.category,pd.asin
  ORDER BY sale_count DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```
  3. Finding trends in order cancellation by-products
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    sr.sku, 
    pd.category, 
    COUNT(sr.status) AS cancellations
  FROM sales_report AS sr
  JOIN products_data AS pd ON sr.sku = pd.sku

  GROUP BY sr.sku, pd.category
  ORDER BY cancellations DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```
  4. Compare shipped vs cancel order each month
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(month FROM date) AS Month, 
    COUNT (date) as numberofsale,
    COUNT (CASE WHEN status = 'Cancelled' THEN 1 END) AS TotalCancellations,
    COUNT (CASE WHEN status = 'Shipped' THEN 1 END) AS TotalShipped
  FROM 
    sales_report
  GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(month FROM date)
  ORDER BY 
    TotalCancellations DESC;
  ```
  5.Finding products sale each month
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(month FROM date) AS Month, 
    pd.category,
    ROUND (SUM(amount)) AS TotalSales
  FROM 
    sales_report AS sr
  JOIN products_data AS pd ON pd.sku = sr.sku
  GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(month FROM date), 
    pd.category
  ORDER BY 
    Month, 
    TotalSales DESC;
  ```

  2. Reassess product descriptions and images to ensure accuracy.
  3. Improve quality control processes for top-cancellation SKUs.
- Address Category-Specific Trends
  Categories like Western Dress and Sets dominate both sales and cancellations.
  Action:
  1. Focus on reducing returns by offering detailed sizing guides and fit reviews for high-return categories.
  2. Explore offering free size exchanges instead of full returns to minimize cancellations.
- Seasonal Demand Management
  Sales data reveals significant monthly variation in product sales. For example, Western Dresses saw sales peak in April (2,927,781) but decline in June (3,899,334).
  Action:
  1. Optimize inventory levels based on seasonal sales trends to prevent overstocking and cancellations due to unfulfilled demand.
  2. Plan targeted promotions for declining categories to maintain sales momentum.
- Monitor Fulfillment Issues by Month
  Monthly data shows a high disparity between orders and shipments, especially in April, where 7,137 orders were canceled.
  Action:
  1. Evaluate the efficiency of logistics operations during peak months.
  2. Strengthen partnerships with courier services to improve reliability and reduce fulfillment delays.
  3. Communicate expected delivery timelines clearly to customers to manage their expectations.
